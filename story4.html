                Space travel remains a distant reality for most of the world's population. But, next year, the sound and shape of your laughter could make it aboard the International Space Station.
              </p>

                A new project by Israeli artist Eyal Gever called "#Laugh" invites members of the public to download an app that generates a unique "star," or digital 3D sculpture, based on the sound of their own recorded laughter.
              </p>
              <p>
                Judged by popular online vote, the winning design will be sent to the International Space Station (ISS) and printed using a pre-installed 3D printer.
              </p>
              <p>
                The project is a collaboration between the artist and UK app developers Platoon and Made in Space.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 2013 Made in Space worked with NASA to install the first 3D printer in ISS and, later the following year, the team were able to print their first object.
              </p>
              <p>
                "I think we can confidently say this will be the first sculptural art made in space," Spencer Pitman, Made in Space's product strategy director, wrote in a statement for CNN.
              </p>
              <p>
                "More importantly, '#Laugh' uses some of the best things that humanity ever created to reflect our culture," Pitman added.
              </p>
              <p>
                Gever often works with energy -- such as sounds and movements -- to create sculptures.
              </p>
              <p>
                Laughter generates a significant amount of energy and allowed Gever to produce a variety of shapes and forms.
              </p>
              <p>
                "Lately, the world seems to be dominated by racism and the rise of right wing politics. Laughter is something we can all do, and that unifies us," Gever told CNN.
              </p>
              <img class="story-img" src="assets/story1img2.jpg">
              <p>
                The artist explained that he chose geometric elements to represent laughter because they are recognizable to everyone.
              </p>
              <p>
                "We call them primitives. They are basic shapes from which unique sculptures can be created," Gever explained.
              </p>
              <p>
                But there was a bigger question for the artist: Whose laugh would represent humanity?
              </p>
              <p>
                "Social media was the answer. I wanted the world to participate. The most popular laughter -- etched in space -- will be sourced from the wisdom of the crowd," said Gever.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Israeli artist hopes that in the future people using the app will be able to purchase sculptures of their laughs to display at home.
              </p>
              <p>
                "It is a journey from voice to code, and from code to something tangible and artistic," said Gever.
              </p>
              <p>
                According to the artist, laughter reminds people that there is beauty in humanity. He sees the project as an opportunity to focus on what really matters:
              </p>
              <p>
                "Parents can immortalize their baby's laughter. Above all this project is meant to make us think of how we want to be represented in the future."
